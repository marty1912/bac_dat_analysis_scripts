## DATA ANALYSIS GROUP 1

in this folder you can find all the scripts used to analize the data for group 1

# how it works:

if you are on mac or on linux you can run the shellscript "merge_and_zip.sh" by exexuting it in a terminal.
type:
```
./merge_and_zip.sh
```


the shell script will execute a few R scripts that create the data files we need for our analysis.
afterwards all data files are added to an zip archive.
